    "Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and analyze data. Python is a general-purpose language, not specialized for any specific problems, and used to create various programmes.\n",

    "What are some of the major benefits of using Python? Why are so many people taught Python in college—and why do they continue to use it in their careers:\r\n",

    "Python is easy. Python is an easy language to learn and use. In fact, Python is often cited as being one of the easiest languages to learn and use. First, its syntax is very simple, flexible, and forgiving. As an interpreted rather than compiled language, it’s harder to get a fatal error. Python data structures are very easy to learn. And many libraries and code snippets are out there, so you can find examples of pretty much anything.\r\n",

    "ted. Python has an extraordinarily active community. If a new programmer has a question about Python, they can ask and get answers almost immediately. This means that new programmers aren’t left confused or adrift.\r\n",
    "Python has a lot of utilities. It’s frequently used as the language of choice in development systems, such as game development kits, mobile development kits, and other forms of software development platforms. \r\n",
    "Python is fast. Because Python is easy to use, Python programmers tend to be quite fast. They can implement simple solutions quickly. It’s free and open source, and tons of libraries and code snippets are avail#Applications for Python\r\n",
    "Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.\n",
